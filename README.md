"nautilus fortress 2"

1) "MONDaC"
    "Model of Nautilus Development and Construction": The world generator for twentythousand gives the player some various launch options through Nemo's use of the MONDaC in the water near Venice. Players start the game with the choice of one Marvelous Device of the Startup Set (Elastic Hull I, Dynamic Drive I, Improved Core, Unmanned Crawler, Fore Bay II). Players start the game with their choice of First Recruits, which determine the predominant Nationality of the Crew. MONDaC announces the First Problem at random, which affects either the Nautilus or the Crew but not both. In 1:100 games, Nemo begins the game Troubled. In 1:10000 games, the Nautilus begins with the Midas Module.
       "Marvelous Devices": The Nautilus can be improved with a number of Marvelous Devices which can either be Purchased at Port, 
       Plundered, or Improvised by the Crew. The startup set describes:
           "Elastic Hull I" - The Hull can tolerate Depth with slower Embrittlement.
           "Dynamic Drive I" - The Nautilus Moves faster when Under Power.
           "Improved Core" - The Nautilus can Drive more Modules.
           "Unmanned Crawler" - The Nautilus can deploy a Remote Operated Vehicle to search the ocean floor and recover objects while not Under Power.
           "Fore Bay II" - The Fore Bay adds an additional Hardpoint and increases Occupancy by one.
           "Midas Module" - The Nautilus recovers 1 Gold per month from the Ocean, but Core Radiation is increased by one.
      After the Nautilus is generated, the game generates the Seafloor, the Continents, the Ocean, the Sky, and the Political Map.
   
   The Nautilus may change semi-permanent parameters at the original MONDaC, or at an Auxiliary MONDaC elsewhere. The Nautilus can 
   install Modules at a Port or at a MONDaC, but it cannot change semi-permanent parameters at a Port. If attacked, a MONDaC will 
   send a Distress Call to the Bridge, and deploy any Emergency Measures the Crew have stowed aboard it. Each Emergency Measure 
   will protect it from siege for twenty-four Hours.
   
3) "The Nautilus."
    Nemo's Silent Synthetic Submersible, constructed by the MONDaC off the coast of Venice. Various components govern the 
    operation of the Nautilus, all of which can be modified by the player:
       "Outer Hull": The Outer Hull has Mass and Brittleness, and the space between the outer and inner hull determines the 
       maximum depth of a Dive.
   
4) Crew
    General. The Crew are Human. They have Health (which decreases temporarily if they are Injured and permanently if they are 
    Maimed), Charisma (which decreased permanently if maimed), Initiative (which never decreases and can temporarily increase), 
    and Stamina (which limits the time a character can take actions before Rest). The Crew learn Languages and start with at least 
    one, and Languages determine their ability to work together on tasks. The Nautilus cannot support unlimited Crew. The 
    theoretical maximum in this version of the rules is 125. Troubled Crew are subject to certain conditions
   
    "Captain Nemo" - The Player Character. Nemo starts with Five Health, Seven Charisma, Six Initiative, and Six Stamina. The game 
    ends if Nemo is Killed, unless the Synthetique is installed. Nemo starts the game with the Hardened Trait, an additional 
    random Trait, English Language , and the Language of the player's choice of First Recruits.
